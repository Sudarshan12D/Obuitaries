# The Obituaries Application

* Developed a full-stack application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend, and utilized Terraform and Python for the backend infrastructure, with all the created data stored on AWS.
* Users input a photo, name, date of birth, and date of death, the app then makes a personalized obituary.
* A Python function feeds a prompt to ChatGPT, generating a unique obit text based on the given details.
* The obit from GPT is converted to speech using the Amazon Polly, A Text-to-Speech software.
* The user-uploaded image and the Converted Speech are stored in Cloudinary, ensuring efficient, secure, and optimized handling of visual data for the generated obituary.
* The final obituary showcases the image alongside the ChatGPT-generated paragraph. An integrated play button activates the audio that narrates the paragraph.
